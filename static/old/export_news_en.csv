			 Traditionally, Russia was represented by a stand of RACUS organization in cooperation with the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Rabat of the Russian Embassy in Morocco. Every school or university student and also parents could receive comprehensive information about the possibility of admission to the universities of RACUS group, about getting a quality and prestigious education and internationally recognized degrees in one of 500 medical, technical, engineering, economic specialties and humanities. And all that for a reasonable price! Visitors of the stand were able to ask all their questions about admission requirements, specifics of studies and student life in Russia. Pupils and students were happy to learn that in Russia it is possible to study the most demanded specialties in French and English, while their parents were glad to learn that RACUS organization insures parent’s control of students throughout the whole period of studies.

				 During the period of 21 to 28 March 2017 the delegation of the group of Russian State universities RACUS took part in the international educational fair of higher education in the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria that was held in three cities – Annaba, Algiers and Oran. This educational fair is the biggest one in the country and every year a huge number of school leavers and their parents from all parts of Algeria come visit it. In 2017 besides national Algerian universities, other countries’ universities were also represented – USA, Canada, Germany, France, Tunisia, UAE, Turkey and Cyprus. RACUS organization was the only representative of the Russian higher education and it assured the top high level of the presentation of the wide opportunities for obtaining prestigious and at the same time affordable higher education in Russia.
			</div>
			<div class=""c-page__headed-section-block-text"">
				 As usual, the participation of RACUS organization in international educational fair attracts the attention of Algerian media. In particular, the most popular Algerian newspaper edited in French “El Watan” invited the school leavers to benefit from this chance to meet the Russian delegation in Algeria in order to get the information directly from them. Algerian TV channels were also interested in the Russian stand and they interviewed the members of the Russian delegation and RACUS representative in Algeria. 
			</div>
			<div class=""c-page__headed-section-block-text"">
				 RACUS organization invited the First Secretary of the Embassy of Russia in Algeria Mr. D. Chudnikh to visit the stand of “Higher education in Russia 2017” that he kindly accepted. During his visit to the fair, there were discussed the possibilities of the extension of the collaboration between Russia and Algeria in the sphere of education and also the necessity of further promotion of Russian higher education in the market of educational services of Algeria. It is to be noted that first active steps in this direction were undertaken already the next day during the meeting of the Director General of RACUS organization Mr. A.Nutsalov and Head of the department of Northern and Western Africa Ms. A.Oleynikova with the Ambassador of Russia in Algeria Mr. A.Zolotov and the First Secretary of the Embassy of Russia in Algeria Mr. D.Chudnikh. Mr.Nutsalov and Ms.Oleynikova also met the Director of Cooperation and Interuniversity exchanges of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Algeria Mr. A.Saidani. During this meeting they discussed the current questions in the sphere of higher education, issues of the interuniversity exchanges and the obstacles to admitting Algerian youth to studies in Russian State universities.
			</div>
			<div class=""c-page__headed-section-block-text"">
				 It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the stand of the group of Russian State universities RACUS became the center of attraction for the visitors of the fair in all three cities: both the Algerian school leavers and the parents of students who already study at universities of RACUS group took benefit of meeting the Russian delegation and the representative of RACUS Algeria. Parents of the students were expressed their gratitude for the possibility to get the information about academic results of their children and for the help of RACUS organization to realize their children’s dream of obtaining prestigious higher education. Among the stand’s visitors there also were the graduates of Soviet universities who studies in USSR and came to the fair to share their great memories and experience of their studentship in Soviet Union.

Parents of some visitors obtained higher education in the universities of Russia or USSR and now are now looking back to this time with nostalgia and acknowledgement, that is why they would like that their children become high-quality specialists in Russia. For another thing, friends of some visitors are now studying in Russia and are telling about their bright students’ life in Russia to their friends.

			 The staff of the Academy, the parents of graduates expressed their gratefulness with kind wishes and farewell words. Graduates shared their impressions of the years spent at the Academy, thanked everybody who supported and inspired them. It was a great joy to look at the graduates who were standing on stage handing their diplomas, smiling and throwing their academic hats up as a sign of graduation. These students have gone through such a hard way and now they deservedly received a prestigious Russian diploma, which gives endless opportunities for employment and continuing education in any part of the world. Some of these young beautiful graduates will return to their homeland and become a new minister of health, someone will open his or her own pharmacy and help a whole nation, bringing contribution to the country's health care, and someone will decide to continue their education in residency, and the staff of the group of Russian state universities RACUS will help them with great pleasure.

				 March 2017 in Morocco was pretty rich on educational events. In half of the month RACUS organisation together with Russian center of science and culture in Rabat under the patronage of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Morocco took part in the international educational fairs in 9 cities of the Kingdom: Agadir, Guelmim, Fez, Rabat, Tangier, Oujda, Mekhnes, Kenitra and El Jadida.

			<div class=""c-page__headed-section-block-text"">
				 Educational fairs in Morocco are well-known all around the country: they are held under the patronage of His Majesty the King Mohammed VI and with the support of the Ministry of Higher education, scientific research and training of specialists of Kingdom of Morocco. These fairs always get the wide media coverage and have the honor to invite the provinces’ governors and the representatives of Moroccan schools and universities administrations to the opening ceremony.
			</div>
			<div class=""c-page__headed-section-block-text"">
				 Probably no visitor of the fairs could miss the bright and colorful stand of the “Group of Russian State universities RACUS”, where they were able to get the complete information about advantages of Russian higher education. Representatives of RACUS in Morocco were glad to present to the visitors 20 Russian State universities located in 10 cities of the European part of Russia, where every future student will definitely find the specialty of his choice, because the universities of RACUS group offer programs in over 500 medical, engineering, technical, economic and humanities specialties, and studies are available not only in Russian language, but also in French and in English. The school leavers were happy to know that obtaining of prestigious higher education of excellent quality is accessible to them. They got answers to all their questions about life and studies in Russia and about the procedure of enrollment to Russian State universities and documents needed for admission. No one left the Russian stand without an information brochure and goodies with RACUS and universities logo.
			</div>
			<div class=""c-page__headed-section-block-text"">
				 To get more information and to apply for studies in Russian State universities of RACUS group, all candidates are welcome to RACUS office in Rabat.

Anna explained that Russian higher education programs are offered at a more affordable price of $3,000-$4,000 per year compared to the United States offering programs that cost more than $ 25,000 per year. The reason of the lower price is that Russian government is interested in the fact that foreign students receive high-quality Russian higher education and return home as ambassadors of Russia. That is why Russian government partially subsidies University seats for foreign students, which covers the biggest part of tuition fees. <br>

                The main goal of the education exhibition was to acquaint Congolese school-leavers, who have just received their school certificates some days ago, with the large possibilities of obtaining affordable high-quality higher education in Russia – country ranking 3rd in the world for the number of foreign students (about 250 000). Parents of some visitors obtained higher education in the universities of Russia or USSR and now are now looking back to this time with nostalgia and acknowledgement, that is why they would like that their children become high-quality specialists in Russia. For another thing, friends of some visitors are now studying in Russia and are telling about their bright students’ life in Russia to their friends. It is not surprising that these factors contributed to a high attendance and visitors’ interest.
                RACUS organization employees showed to the visitors videos and presentations about Russian science achievements, about rich history and culture of the country, about high scientific potential, founded by Russian scientists – graduates of Russian State universities. Apart from that education exhibition visitors got acquainted with more than 20 Russian State universities of RACUS group offering more than 500 medical, engineering, economic and humanities specialties taught in Russian and French. Thus, Russian State universities of RACUS group give the choice between studying in Russian medium, which will help young Congolese to learn on of the wide-spread languages of the world, the official language of UN, and in French medium, almost native language, in such specialties as General Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy.
            The visitors could receive complete information about Russian education system, rules of foreign students’ admission to studies in Russian universities, about accommodation conditions in students’ hostels, having asked all their questions.
                All the visitors of the education exhibition «Study in Russia–2016» in Congo received brochures in French with the full information about rules of admission to studies, universities list, available specialties, and tuition fees. Every visitor was invited to get an individual consultation at the representation offices of RACUS organization in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, because the admission to studies for the 2016/2017 academic year is open till the 1st of October 2016.

				 The academic year in schools of Republic of Congo has come to the end, the graduation classes has already passed their exams and ex-schoolchildren, and now prospective students have a difficult choice: how to become a high achiever, how to obtain a highly sought profession, how and where obtain higher education. In order to show the school-leavers a wide specter of possibilities that they have, the representation of the group of Russian State universities – RACUS every year holds special education exhibitions «Study in Russia» that shows the candidates undeniable advantages of obtaining an affordable high quality higher education at Russian State universities of RACUS group. In 2016, on June 17-18th, the education exhibition «Study in Russia-2016» traditionally took place in two biggest cities of the Republic of Congo – in the capital Brazzaville, where the exhibition was organized on the base of Russian centre of science and culture, and in Pointe-Noire (industrial capital of Congo), where Honorary Consulate of Russia in Congo gave support to the organization RACUS to hold the exhibition. During the holding of the education exhibition the school graduates and their parents received a lot of useful information about higher education in Russia. In particular, RACUS organization employees illustrated to the visitors the optimal quality-to-price ratio of Russian higher education: average tuition fees at the prestigious Russian universities with centenary history are of 2500-3500 USD per academic year. These not too high in comparison with other countries fees have to do with the fact that Russian government subsidizes big sums into higher education. The undeniable advantage is the fact that studies at RACUS group universities are available not only in Russian medium, but also in French and English medium. Without doubt, the Congolese school graduates got to know enthusiastically that such specialities as General Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry are available in French medium and this in several universities at their choice: Tambov State university, Astrakhan State medical university, Pyatigorsk medical pharmaceutical institute and Saint-Petersburg State chemical pharmaceutical academy. On top of that, during the education exhibition the visitors got to know a little bit more about cultural life in Russia, about such different climate conditions of the country, about students' pastime during their studies. Probably, after this exhibition the distance between two countries was shortened, at least in the visitors' perception. Without doubt, visiting of the special education exhibition «Study in Russia-2016» will give to the school graduates of the Republic of Congo, who are waiting for their certificates BAC and transcripts, the possibility to think about studies in Russian State universities of RACUS group.

				 March 2016 came to its end. It will be remembered by many Moroccan enrollees and their parents who had visited international educational fairs in 10 cities of Morocco where RACUS group of Russian State Universities took part in association with Russian center of science and culture in Rabat and with the support of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Morocco. Fairs were held in such major administrative centers as Casablanca, El Jadid, Tetuan, Marrakech, Rabat, Béni Mellal, Tangier, Meknes, Agadir and Guelmim. <br>
				 It’s rather exciting and very important period for students graduating Moroccan high schools now. They are just several months away from the moment when they pass final exams and know the results. And right now most of them take a fateful decision: which university and specialty to choose and of course which country to choose to get competitive and high-quality higher education. <br>
				 To go abroad to obtain higher education doesn’t frighten Moroccan youth. In fact it attracts high school graduates who are willing to take such an important step and their parents. It’s great language practice, new friends, understanding the specifics and the mentality of other countries, new culture to explore. <br>
				 While choosing the country to go for a higher education, a person pays attention to the the university authority, university status, recognition of university diplomas (in Morocco and all over the world), highly-qualified academic personnel, classrooms and laboratories equipped with modern technology, new teaching technologies and of course recommendations of friends and relatives. Thanks to RACUS group of Russian State Universities participation at international educational fairs, Moroccans know that RACUS Russian State Universities meet the above-mentioned requirements. RACUS group of Russian State Universities offers more than 500 medical, technical, economic and humanitarian specialties delivered in Russian, in French and in English. <br>
				 International educational fairs in Morocco being well advertised in the national media have high credibility among the citizens of Morocco due to the fact they are held under the auspices of His Majesty the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, as well as with the support of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Morocco. In March international educational fairs opening ceremonies were attended by governors of regions, wali of regions, principles of Morocco high schools and universities, and also by heads of regional career guidance centers. <br>
				 Every year these international educational fairs with active participation of RACUS group of Russian State Universities attract a huge amount of interested visitors due to its high status. <br>
				 During March exhibitions Moroccan enrollees and their parents have shown great interest to the Russian stand: thousands of students visited the Russian stand. Each stand visitor received detailed information about studying in the best Russian State Universities, members of RACUS group, with recognized diplomas in Morocco, about admission rules at the universities, about necessary documents, about interesting student life, residence rules in the territory of Russia and many more other moments that interested stand visitors. <br>
				 As before the most popular specialties among Morocco school-leavers were medical specialties which is natural. There are thousands of Morocco students currently studying at Russian medical universities. They share with friends and relatives that they are well theoretically prepared and also that they start practice classes in hospitals and medical institutions in 6 months during the 1st years of studies. Students are constantly developing, adopting the knowledge of experienced doctors and practicing professors during the whole training period. Such approach allows to future doctors to be fully prepared for the real work after graduation and to be in demand on the job market. <br>
				 It’s recognized that more and more Moroccan school-leavers choose engineering and technical specialties, such as Civil Engineering, Architecture, Machinery, Agronomy and Mining taught in North-Caucasian State University for Mining and Metallurgy, Federal University of North Caucasus, Peter the Great Saint-Petersburg Polytechnic University, Nizhny Novgorod State University for Architecture and Civil Engineering, Novgorod State University, Saratov State Agricultural University and Nizhny Novgorod State University. <br>
				 Every high school graduate who visited RACUS educational stand was provided with colorful brochures and with RACUS and “Study in Russia” symbols. <br>
				 To get an additional consultation on studies at RACUS group of Russian State Universities and to apply for all interested graduates and their parents are welcome to RACUS official representative office in Rabat, Morocco.

She was specially invited to the fair to give the most reliable first-hand information. <br>
				 Education fair Study in Russia – 2016 undoubtedly helped visitors to find their way in choosing of the future profession and of course to choose Russia as the country where one can get affordable, high-quality and internationally recognized higher education. <br>

				 On June 29, 2016 conference hall of the hotel ""Pribaltiyskaya"" became the venue for the graduation ceremony where foreign graduates of Saint-Petersburg State Chemical Pharmaceutical Academy (SPbSCPA) were awarded diplomas of Pharmacists after 5 years of studies at the Academy in French language through RACUS organization. <br>
				 Apart from the happy graduates from different countries (such as Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Congo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Namibia, Vietnam, Turkmenistan, Mongolia and Madagascar) and their parents the graduation ceremony was also attended by: <br>
				 - Igor Narkevich, Rector of SPbSCPA, <br>
				 - Anton Karasavidi, Vice-Rector for Foreign Students and International Relations at SPbSCPA, <br>
				 - Karim Bennani, Economic Advisor to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Morocco in Moscow, <br>
				 - Avbakar Nutsalov, General Director of RACUS organization, <br>
				 - Ksenia Sholokhova, Head of the North African Department of RACUS organization, <br>
				 - teaching staff of SPbSCPA, <br>
				 and certainly the relatives of the graduates who came from afar in order to support and be happy for their children – already graduates with higher education.<br>
				 There was friendly and warm atmosphere from the beginning of the graduation ceremony: beautiful and spacious hall, graduates in smart evening dresses and business suits, parents, proud of their children, teaching staff and university administration, not as rigorous and demanding as it was during studies, – and all with sincere smiles and happy eyes. <br>
				 Igor Narkevich, Rector of SPbSCPA, made a welcoming speech, told about the progress that students made during the whole period of study at the Academy and how nice it is to look at the matured and decent graduates and wished them success.<br>
				 Rector noted that all this was made possible primarily thanks to RACUS organization, General Director of which proposed 5 years ago to the administration of the university to implement new project and to open Pharmacy program in the French Medium at the Pharmaceutical Faculty of the Academy of Russia's for the labor market of foreign countries. Happy faces of foreign graduates demonstrated that this project was successfully implemented. The pilot project to train foreign students on the Pharmacy program in the French language has allowed 59 foreign students from francophone African countries to become highly qualified specialists and opened to them the doors to life! <br>
				 Avbakar Nutsalov, General Director of RACUS organization, also made a welcoming speech and congratulated the graduates and their parents, thanked the employees of the Academy, employees of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Morocco in Russia and Russian Embassy in Morocco for the assistance and support given to RACUS organization to promote Russian higher education in the Kingdom and to prepare highly qualified specialists for the labor market of Morocco in Russian state universities, members of the RACUS group.<br>
				 Teachers and parents expressed their good wishes to the graduates and thanked the staff of the Academy and RACUS organization. In their replies graduates have expressed gratitude to all those who were close to them during the whole period of study and said that these 5 years will remain forever in their memories as the happiest, despite periodic challenges that every student has (especially before the exams). Students worked hard and have achieved what they wanted – received prestigious Degrees of Russian national standard, which is recognized in every country of the world and will allow to fulfill their potential in the chosen profession, as well as if desired to continue their education in Russia and foreign countries. <br>
				 In fact, everyone is waiting for his or her own way: someone will go home to start to work, to gain experience and perhaps to open pharmacy, and someone will take a decision to continue the university path and enter clinical residency program. Employees of the group of Russian state universities – RACUS will be pleased to help them to do that. <br>
				 RACUS organization congratulates the graduates of the Academy on this significant day in their life and wishes them to achieve professional success, which is certainly already waiting for them at home. <br>
				 Taking the opportunity RACUS organization expresses its deep gratitude to Igor Narkevich, Rector of the Academy, Anton Karasavidi, Vice-Rector for Foreign Students and International Relations, and teaching staff of the Academy for their hard work to prepare graduates in the field of pharmacy for foreign countries and well organized graduation ceremony. <br>

				 The academic year in Botswana has ended, and now high school graduates and their parents think about which country to go to get quality education at a reasonable price. Parents want to be sure not only about high quality of educational programs, but also about living conditions in the country they choose, along with future students. Educational exhibitions, which take place in Botswana, as well as active advertising campaign run by RACUS organization in the country, help young people of Botswana to make the right choice. <br>
				 From the 16th to 19th of March RACUS organization took part in the annual international educational exhibition “Career Fair – 2016” held in Gaborone, the capital of the Republic of Botswana. Employees of RACUS representative office in Botswana introduced to all the visitors Russia -country of great opportunities and prospects. This year the stand of RACUS organization had enjoyed enormous popularity among the visitors, which indicates the fact that interest to study in Russia is growing every year. <br>
				 Visitors of the stand of RACUS organization were presented more than 20 Russian State Universities, members of the RACUS group that offer applicants education on more than 500 medical, engineering, economic and humanitarian specialties in Russian, English and French languages.

				 The academic year in Botswana has ended, and now there is a new long distance in front of yesterday's pupils that will lead them to a diploma of higher education.

				 In recent years, Botswana applicants are opting more and more often for higher education in Russia. The growth of interest to this country is not accidental, since education in Russian state universities is synonymous to a great knowledge base, which will enable Botswana students to be highly paid and respected workers in any country of the world for many years. <br>
				 Specialized educational exhibitions that are held every year by RACUS organization in the country help young people of Botswana to make the right choice where to study. On February 29, 2016 RACUS organization with the support of the Embassy of Russia in Botswana held its annual specialized educational exhibition ""Study in Russia – 2016"" in the conference hall of «Avani Hotel», one of the largest hotels in the country located in the capital – Gaborone. <br>

				 The exhibition began with a presentation of higher education in Russia thanks to which all visitors of the event were provided with reliable and comprehensive information on the possibility of obtaining prestigious and accessible higher education at Russian state universities, members of the RACUS group. The youth of Botswana was watching videos about Russia with a sincere interest and was attentively listening to Elena Molefi, head of RACUS representative office in Botswana, who gave details about the rules of admission to Russian state universities, the living conditions in dormitories and a great friendly atmosphere that allows all students to succeed in school and achieve their goals, as well as answered numerous questions of the visitors. <br>
				 Organizers of the exhibition presented the graduates of Botswana schools and their parents more than 20 Russian state universities, members of the RACUS group, that offer education on more than 500 medical, technical, engineering, economic specialties and humanities. It should be noted that medical specialties traditionally popular among Botswana youth, as well as geological exploration, oil and mining specialties, which are always in high demand in Botswana, were in the focus of attention. In particular, the students showed the greatest interest to the North-Caucasian State University for Mining and Metallurgy.

The Medical Faculty of the Tambov State University deserves particular attention as its prime advantage is the possibility to obtain higher education in English, for example, degree in General Medicine. <br>
				 At the exhibition the guests were extremely interested in Saratov State Agrarian University, where it’s possible to undergo Veterinary and Agronomy in English which certainly follows the economic demands of Zambia as agriculture accounts for 85% of total employment. The high level of practical training is due to the special educational facilities. The leading enterprises of the region are also involved in the process of studies, and this fact has a great positive influence on the practical professional training of the students and graduates of the university. Undoubtedly Zambian prospective students and their parents met with great enthusiasm the presentation of Saratov State Agrarian University. <br>
				 Visitors also learned about such universities as Nizhny Novgorod State University, Federal University of North Caucasus, Astrakhan State Medical University, Novgorod State Universities and etc. A lot of school-leavers were pleased to know that many programs at Russian state universities of the RACUS group are taught in English. <br>

Being graduates of Russian universities and successful specialists today, they talked about their experience, about how they loved their period of studies in Russia and how it was easy to find a job in Zambia. <br>
				 Russian teacher of the Russian center of Science and Culture in Lusaka gave a presentation titled “Russian language master class”, in which she illustrated the practicality of learning such a beautiful and rich language as Russian with 400 million speakers in the world. The presentation was interactive and had members of the audience participating by repeating basic Russian phrases. <br>
				 Harold Mabula, head of RACUS organization in Zambia held individual consultations for the most interested visitors about the education system, about choosing the university and specialty, and about the invitation for studies, as well as Russian culture and traditions. <br>

Also, visitors were invited to the official representative office of RACUS in Lusaka to apply for studies in 2016/2017 academic year. <br>

The activities carried out by RACUS organization and Russian Center of Science and Culture in Lusaka, which organizes actively throughout the year educational workshops in schools and educational exhibitions for the promotion of Russian higher education in Zambia and provides quality services for Zambian applicants for admission to more than 20 prestigious Russian state universities that constitute the RACUS group, contributes largely to this fact. <br>
				 The exhibition began with video presentations by Representatives of RACUS organization in Zambia about Russian state universities, members of the RACUS group, each of which reflected the priority research areas and achievements of each university. Visitors had an excellent opportunity to get information about studying in Russia and get acquainted with such universities as Nizhny Novgorod State University, Tambov State University, Federal University of North Caucasus, Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University, Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping , Astrakhan State Medical University, Novgorod State University, Saratov State Agricultural University and others, that offer education on more than 500 specialties in Russian, English and French Medium. As usual, visitors showed high interest in such specialties as medicine, pharmacy, architecture and engineering, as well as in some specialties in the field of economy, technology and humanities. <br>
				 At the invitation of RACUS organization teachers of Russian Language from Russian Center of Science and Culture in Lusaka held a humorous presentation ""Russia – Survival Guide"", where they described in a humorous way life of Zambian students studying in Russian universities. They also did not forget to mention about rich culture and traditions of Russia, which aroused particular interest among the audience. At the end of the presentation exhibition visitors were able to ask their questions, and the representative of RACUS organization was glad to answer any questions about his personal experience of education in Russia. For everyone, who wanted to know more details, it was given RACUS brochures and souvenirs. <br>
				 During the conversations with the representatives of RACUS organization at the exhibition some visitors have already applied for education in Russia by choosing university and training program. The made their choice, according to them, due to the fact, that Russia is one of the world leaders in the field of education, and Russian diploma opens wonderful career opportunities for Zambian students, giving them a chance to study at an affordable price and receive professions, demanded on the labor market in Zambia.

				 On 25th of July 2015 in the capital of Zambia, in Lusaka, RACUS organization in cooperation with Russian Center of Science and Culture (RCSC) in Lusaka held an educational exhibition Study in Russia – 2015. <br>
				 The education in Russia becomes more and more attractive for Zambian youth due to the activities of RACUS organization which promotes education in Russia, in cooperation with RCSC in Lusaka. Many educational events (exhibitions, seminars, conferenсes) are also held in Zambia under the aegis of RACUS. <br>
				 The educational exhibition Study in Russia – 2015 brought forth a lot of visitors who wanted to make their dreams about fundamental and high-quality education in one of the most perspective country of the world – Russia, come true. <br>
				 During the exhibition, the representatives of RACUS in Zambia made interactive presentations about studying in Russia, about all the advantages of Russian education and also about the perspectives of learning Russian. By the end of presentation, the participants had a chance to ask RACUS representatives any questions about Russia and its educational system. <br>
				 The medical specialities (General Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy) are traditionally popular with students. Their popularity can be explained by the fact that these specialties not only highly crucial for the country, but also in demand on the labour market. Along with medical specialties, the visitors also took interest in economic and technical specialties (Informational Technologies, Economics, Civil Engineering, Oil and Gas Engineering), which are taught in both English and Russian. Apart from taking a look at terms and condition of foreign students' admission to Russian state universities, candidates got acquainted with the list of the RACUS group universities: Nizhny Novgorod State University, Tambov State University, North-Caucasus Federal University, Peter the Great Saint-Petersburg Polytechnic University, Astrakhan State Medical University, Novgorod State University, Saratov State Agricultural University and others. <br>
				 In 2015, 10 major educational exhibitions and seminars held in Zambia annually undoubtedly promote fruitful and long-lasting cooperation and firm friendly ties between our two countries, as well as sustain the inexhaustible interest of young Zambians in obtaining prestigious higher education in Russia and open wide new professional and personal prospects for Zambians. <br>
				 During the exhibition some of the participants have already applied to Russian state universities, and chose programs with RACUS representative's help. According to them, Russia is one of the leaders in the field of education, and Russian diplomas open great prospects for Zambian candidates, giving them a possibility to study in Russian universities with affordable fees and to get a profession, which would be in-demand on Zambian labour market.

				 RACUS organization together with Russian Center for Science and Culture (RCSC) held an educational exhibition Study in Russia – 2015 in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, on June 20, 2015. <br>
				 The exhibition has once again proven that RACUS organization's effective activities aimed at the popularization of Russian higher education in Zambia are moving into the right direction and help to establish Russian state universities' authority on the international scene. The educational exhibition Study in Russia – 2015 was very popular with young Zambians, who wish to fulfil their dreams of obtaining high quality fundamental education in one of the most prospective countries of the modern world – Russia. <br>
				 The representatives of the RACUS organization in Zambia have shown several interactive presentatives about studying in Russia to the visitors of the exhibition, who had a chance to learn all about studying in Russia in an intersting and exciting format, in particular about the Russian educational system and the advantages of learning Russian. Mr Kelly Mwantalasha, a 2013 graduate of Tambov State University, was a special guest of the exhibition. He told the Zambians applicants all about living and studying in Russia and how he liked the professors, nature and Russian cuisine, a very comfortable studying environment, which he often feels nostalgic for. After the presentations, all those in attendance had a chance to put their questions to Kelly Mwantalasha as well as to the RACUS representatives in Zambia. <br>
				 Young Zambians, as previously, were primarily interested in medical specialties (such as General Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy) as they are in high demand on the labour market. However, the visitors of the exhibition were also enquiring about such economic and engineering and technical specialties as Information Technologies, Economics, Civil Engineering, Oil &amp; Gas, which are taught not only in Russian, but also in English. All those who wanted to receive more detailed information about the admission of foreign students to Russian universities and learn more about studying in Russia in general were provided with RACUS brochures and souvenirs. <br>
				 10 major educational exhibitions and seminars held in Zambia annually undoubtedly promote fruitful and long-lasting cooperation and firm friendly ties between our two countries, as well as sustain the inexhaustible interest of young Zambians in obtaining prestigious higher education in Russia and open new professional and personal prospects for Zambians. <br>
				 The next exhibition in Zambia's capital Lusaka will take place on July 18 and RACUS organization and Russian Center for Science and Culture invite you to take part in it!

				 In the end of May 2015, 9 cities in Russia held diploma awarding ceremonies for foreign graduates of Russian state universities which constitute the RACUS group. <br>
				 This year graduates from 50 Asian, African, Middle East, and European and American countries received their diplomas. Several students were singled out by the university officials for their exceptional skills and their participation in university activities. <br>
				 During the period of studies (about 7 years) the RACUS organization assisted students in both their studies and their life in Russia and also helped to become valued professionals, who would be in demand not only in their countries, but all over the world. They all became friends with their Russian groupmates, and refer to their university as their 'second homeland'. Students themselves created the amiable atmosphere at the ceremony. On their part, the graduates thanked all the professors for the skills they acquired as well as for their kindness and friendly attitude. Some of students spoke in the language which is now like a mother tongue to them – Russian. The audience warmly responded to their speeches. <br>
				 Moreover, during the graduation ceremony, the new graduates heard some parting words from their professors and university administration. The graduates were also celebrated by their parents invited to Russia by RACUS organization and universities. Parents thanked universities and RACUS, and surprised the audience by performing their native songs. <br>
				 The graduates thanked RACUS organization for all the help, patience and for the efforts undertaken to help their children adapt to living and studying in Russia throughout the whole period of their studies. They hope that their compatriots will follow their steps and will study in Russia where they will have a choice from 500 medical, engineering and technical, economic and humanitarian specialties available at Russian universities of the RACUS group.

				 On July 17-19 2015 the organization “RACUS” held an educational exhibition “Study in Russia – 2015” conjointly with Russian linguistic center in Brazzaville (17-18 July) and with Honorary Consulate in Pointe-Noire (18-19 July). The exhibition coincided with the end of final examinations of Congolese school-leavers. <br>
				 The employees of “RACUS” organization conducted consultations for the school-leavers and their parents who were interested in getting the higher education in prestigious Russian state universities. They had the information about the wide geography of “RACUS” group consisting of the universities of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Nijny Novgorod, Tambov, Stavropol, Saratov, Novgorod, Astrakhan and Pyatigorsk. On top of that those universities allow one to choose between more than 500 medical, technical, economic specialties and humanities, so that everyone could get an interesting profession. “RACUS” group universities have a big advantage: some of the specialties are taught in English and French. If a chosen specialty is taught only in Russian, then the school-leaver can apply to take a foundation course to learn Russian language and other subjects depending on the chosen future specialty during one academic year. <br>
				 The visitors got to know an important fact: the diplomas given by the Russian state universities of group “RACUS” are recognized in Congo and in most countries of the world which will permit to future graduates to find employment in Congo or in any other country. <br>
				 The employees of “RACUS” organization provided the whole information about application submission to study in Russia, about the necessary documents, terms of getting the invitation and visa receiving, about the arrival to Russia and accommodation in the students' hostels. The visitors got to know about the rules of living in Russia and particularities of Russian weather. <br>
				 The holding of the educational exhibition “Study in Russia – 2015” helped the visitors to get all the needed information about getting the higher education in Russian state universities of “RACUS” group. The exhibition attracted attention of many school-leavers and helped many of them to make choice of their future professions, thus popularizing Russian higher education in Congo. <br>
				 All the visitors received the information brochures and were invited to submit their documents for admission to study in Russia at the office of “RACUS” organization in Congo.

				 On 11th of July, 2015 in the city of Luanda (Republic of Angola) took place an educational exhibition 'Study in Russia – 2015'. It was organized at support of the Embassy of Russian Federation in Angola. The exhibition was held at the Mediateca of Luanda, which is situated in the very centre of the city.

The best way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is isolation – the whole countries and even continents are closing their borders.

				 The organization RACUS is doing all possible to provide the necessary support for foreign students from 20 universities of our group, to assure their protection. Thanks to the adequate measures of Russian Government and the highly qualified health care service, there is no case of death from coronavirus reported in our country and dozens of patients have already completely recovered. As for the very limited number of individuals, infected during their touristic visit at the epicenters of actual pandemic like Italy, France, Germany, China and some other countries, they are under permanent medical control. Currently, there are only 2 of 10 cities of the European part of Russia, where the universities of our group are located, Moscow and Saint-Petersburg to be more precise, have declared about 50 coronavirus cases. It is important to mention, that all contaminated persons are placed under medical control in hospitals, that excludes any possibility of further contamination and the propagation of virus. <br>
 <br>
				 Our organization provides individual help for each and every foreign student during the whole period of their studies in Russian universities. We are permanently monitoring the actual situation and we are taking it as our duty to inform our students about prophylactic measures and World Health Organization’s recommendations.<br>
 <br>
				 We also stay in permanent contact with students’ parents, because we perfectly understand their concern about their children’s health and well-being while they are thousand miles away from home. None of our student from the universities of RACUS group is infected with coronavirus. In spite of actual situation, that, I sincerely believe, will get better very soon, we will continue to support our students from 72 different countries staying in Russia now.<br>

				 Dear students!  <br>
 <br>
				In response to increasing number of calls and messages from you, I’d like to provide you with the most detailed and complete information on the coronavirus situation in Russia. <br>
 <br>
				 The Russian government is now doing its best to stop the mass spread of coronavirus and to keep the situation under control. All infected patients are hospitalized in specialized hospitals of infectious diseases in order to keep to a minimum the spread and the contamination of those around you.<br>
 <br>
				All schools and universities have switched to distance learning, which also prevents the spread of coronavirus in Russia. Therefore, I can assure you that it is safe to be in Russia these days. Now it is a perfect time for quiet studies at hostels or at home that gives you an opportunity to revise what you have already learned and to check your knowledge. <br>
 <br>
				 Due to the current situation, we urge you to take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:<br>
				 • Wash your hands with soap for about 2 minutes, especially when you come from outside <br>
				 • Don’t touch your face with dirty fingers<br>
				 • Don’t use the public transport during the rush hour unless you have to.<br>
				 • Keep the distance from people at least one meter away (no handshakes, hugs, or kisses).<br>
				 • Let some fresh air into your room several times a day.<br>
				 • Disinfect your smartphone and surfaces that different people touch (such as tables, door handles, etc.)<br>
				 • Do not let other people to use your personal items <br>
 <br>
				 If you have some ARVI (acute respiratory viral infection) symptoms (fever, cough, etc.) call the doctor or free COVID hotline 8-800-200-01-12 (for calls within Russia). <br>
 <br>
				 Our dear students, you are safe! Don't panic, as the situation in Russia is much better than in any other European country and in the large majority of countries throughout the world. Stay safe and wash hands!<br>
 <br>
				 We are with you! <br>

				 At this moment the whole world is fighting against the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19). The actual situation in Russia is totally controlled by the Government. The measures undertaken in time by the Russian Government have considerably reduced a massif propagation of COVID-19 all over the country. Due to these measures the extension of coronavirus disease inside the country is minimal and in general the infection is detected among the individuals returning from the other countries where the epidemic situation is more serious. The state of health of everyone who returns in Russia is checked up at the airports, the individuals with illness symptoms are transported to the hospitals as for those who were in contact with them, they are placed under two-week quarantine. In Russia the treatment of all infected with coronavirus is free of charge for all nationalities.

				<br>
				 The Gamaleya National Epidemiology and Microbiology Research Center and the Russian Ministry of Defence will complete the testing of the vaccine by the end of July. Preclinical tests on monkeys and hamsters have already been successfully completed and no side effects have been detected. The next step will be a vaccine testing on 50 volunteers who have already signed up for vaccination. Some of the doctors and researchers have also voluntarily agreed to vaccinate themselves.<br>
				<br>
				 It is important to mention that the vaccine will be nasal that will significantly speed up the vaccination process. In case of successful completion of all testing procedures, mass production will begin as soon as possible. <br>
				<br>
				 While Russian scientists are working on the vaccine, the government has taken all measures to protect and preserve people's health. The citizen’s safety is above all in Russia.<br>

			 This visa is suitable for travelers coming to Russia for tourist, business, visiting and humanitarian purposes. It will be issued as a single-entry visa that is valid for 60 calendar days with an allowed period of stay in Russia of up to 16 days. <br>
			<br>
			To obtain the visa, foreign citizens will need to fill in an application on the website http://electronic-visa.kdmid.ru/.

It is expected that citizens of 53 foreign countries will have the right of entrance with an electronic visa. There is a visa-free regime of entry to Russia for citizens of 60 other countries. Thus, from January 2021, citizens of 113 foreign countries with a total population of almost 4 billion people will be able to enter Russia without the need for a paper visa. <br>
			<br>
			It is expected that a consular fee of about $50 will be set for the formalization of the new e-visa.

			 By 2024, the number of foreign students accepted to study at Russian state universities should reach 425,000, which means that Russia will enter the TOP-5 exporting countries of higher education. In future foreign students may be granted ""a free, at least one-time, ticket to travel to the place of study and back, free medical insurance, an increased scholarship that allows to really live on it, and compensation for the costs of a hostel,"" said Konstantin Kosachev, Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council. This will make Russia very attractive for ambitious young people from all over the world. In 2021, only according to the government quota, Russia is going to accept 18,000 foreign students to study at universities, which is 3 thousand more than in 2020. In 2022, the quota will be increased to 23,000, and starting from 2023, the admission quota will reach 30,000 people annually. At the same time, the total number of foreign students studying at Russian universities (on scholarships or partial payment of their tuition) should reach 425,000 people in 2024. This is a great success in modern higher education, which proves the high quality of Russian educational programs, the worldwide recognition of diplomas and the demand for graduates by employers around the world. Group of Russian state universities RACUS (<a href=""WWW.EDURUSSIA.RU"">WWW.EDURUSSIA.RU</a>) invites ambitious young people from all over the world who want to achieve success in their careers to study at the TOP-20 Russian universities on more than 500 medical, engineering, technical, economic and humanitarian specialties in Russian, English and French mediums of instruction.

			 Foreign students need to bear the following in mind:  <br><br> 1. The studies in 2021/2022 academic year will start from September 1, 2021 as usual: for the students who are already in Russia, the classes will be held in offline format. For the students who are currently in their home countries (abroad), the classes will be held in online format. In this online format the students will be studying till the moment their invitation letter is formalized in the migration service, they receive their study visa in the Embassy of Russia and actually enter Russia. The whole process takes up to 2 months. After entering Russia, the students will continue their education in the universities in offline format. <br> 2.

				 The space ship controlled by Hero of Russia, commander Anton Shkaplerov delivered film director Klim Shipenko and actress Julia Peresild to the International Space Station. The spaceship was successfully launched fr om Baikonur. The cinema crew has already managed to make contact with Earth and has started the first shooting day. By the design of the Russian film director, with the support of “Roscosmos”, the scenes of the feature film called “Challenge” will be shot in outer space, and the international orbital station will act as decor. Formerly art and documentary projects about space were filmed in special pavilions using the latest computer graphics technologies but now for the first time in the history of world cinema, outer space will become a platform for a feature-length film.

			The whole world was watching the historical launch of the Russian cinema crew. This epic event was covered by all the leading information TV channels of the world. 
Thus, The Wall Street Journal, an American business newspaper, believes that “Russia is one of the leaders of the space race now, leaving NASA and Elon Mask behind”. <br> <br>
The Telegraph, a British edition, reminded readers in its article called “Mission is possible” that while Elon Mask is only preparing to send a Hollywood actor Tom Cruise into space, the Russian filmmakers are already working on the orbital station. This is a great success of Russian science and technology which now shows a high level of development.
